"""Port Statistics testing suite.

This test suite tests the functionality of querying the statistics of a port and verifies that the
values provided in the statistics accurately reflect the traffic that has been handled on the port.
This is shown by sending a packet of a fixed size to the SUT and verifying that the number of Rx
packets has increased by 1, the number of Rx bytes has increased by the specified size, the number
of Tx packets has also increased by 1 (since we expect the packet to be forwarded), and the number
of Tx bytes has also increased by the same fixed amount.

        Packets are considered to be "noise" when they don't match the expected structure of the
        packets that are being sent by this test suite. Specifically, the source and destination
        mac addresses as well as the software packet type are checked on packets received by
        testpmd to ensure they match the proper addresses of the TG and SUT nodes. Packets that are
        sent by testpmd however only check the source mac address and the software packet type.
        This is because MAC forwarding mode adjusts both addresses, but only the source will belong
        to the TG or SUT node.
