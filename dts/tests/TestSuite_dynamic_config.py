"""Dynamic configuration capabilities test suite.

This suite checks that it is possible to change the configuration of a port
dynamically. The Poll Mode Driver should be able to enable and disable
promiscuous mode on each port, as well as check the Rx and Tx packets of
each port. Promiscuous mode in networking passes all traffic a NIC receives
to the CPU, rather than just frames with matching MAC addresses. Each test
case sends a packet with a matching address, and one with an unknown address,
to ensure this behavior is shown.

If packets should be received and forwarded, or received and not forwarded,
depending on the configuration, the port info should match the expected behavior.
