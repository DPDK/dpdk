"""Port Control Testing Suite.

This test suite serves to show that ports within testpmd support basic configuration functions.
Things such as starting a port, stopping a port, and closing a port should all be supported by the
device. Additionally, after each of these configuration steps (outside of closing the port) it
should still be possible to start the port again and verify that the port is able to forward a
large amount of packets (100 are sent in the test cases).
