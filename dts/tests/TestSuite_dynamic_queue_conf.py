"""Dynamic configuration of port queues test suite.

This test suite tests the support of being able to either stop or reconfigure port queues at
runtime without stopping the entire device. Previously, to configure a DPDK ethdev, the application
first specifies how many Tx and Rx queues to include in the ethdev and then application sets up
each queue individually. Only once all the queues have been set up can the application then start
the device, and at this point traffic can flow. If device stops, this halts the flow of traffic on
all queues in the ethdev completely. Dynamic queue is a capability present on some NICs that
specifies whether the NIC is able to delay the configuration of queues on its port. This capability
allows for the support of stopping and reconfiguring queues on a port at runtime without stopping
the entire device.

Support of this capability is shown by starting the Poll Mode Driver with multiple Rx and Tx queues
configured and stopping some prior to forwarding packets, then examining whether or not the stopped
ports and the unmodified ports were able to handle traffic. In addition to just stopping the ports,
the ports must also show that they support configuration changes on their queues at runtime without
stopping the entire device. This is shown by changing the ring size of the queues.

If the Poll Mode Driver is able to stop some queues on a port and modify them then handle traffic
on the unmodified queues while the others are stopped, then it is the case that the device properly
supports dynamic configuration of its queues.
