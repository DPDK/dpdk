"""Mac address filtering test suite.

This test suite ensures proper and expected behavior of Allowlist filtering via mac
addresses on devices bound to the Poll Mode Driver. If a packet received on a device
contains a mac address not contained within its mac address pool, the packet should
be dropped. Alternatively, if a packet is received that contains a destination mac
within the devices address pool, the packet should be accepted and forwarded. This
behavior should remain consistent across all packets, namely those containing dot1q
tags or otherwise.

The following test suite assesses behaviors based on the aforementioned logic.
Additionally, testing is done within the PMD itself to ensure that the mac address
allow list is behaving as expected.

    Moreover, a given port should demonstrate proper behavior when bound to the Poll Mode
