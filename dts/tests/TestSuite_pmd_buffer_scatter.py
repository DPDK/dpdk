"""Multi-segment packet scattering testing suite.

This testing suite tests the support of transmitting and receiving scattered packets.
This is shown by the Poll Mode Driver being able to forward
scattered multi-segment packets composed of multiple non-contiguous memory buffers.
To ensure the receipt of scattered packets,
the DMA rings of the port's Rx queues must be configured
with mbuf data buffers whose size is less than the maximum length.

If it is the case that the Poll Mode Driver can forward scattered packets which it receives,
then this suffices to show the Poll Mode Driver is capable of both receiving and transmitting
scattered packets.
