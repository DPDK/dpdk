"""MTU update and jumbo frame forwarding test suite.

A suite of tests to ensures the consistency of jumbo and standard frame transmission within a DPDK
application. If a NIC receives a packet that is greater than its assigned MTU length, then that
packet should be dropped. Likewise, if a NIC receives a packet that is less than or equal to a
designated MTU length, the packet should be accepted.

The definition of MTU between individual vendors varies with a +/- difference of 9 bytes, at most.
To universally test MTU functionality, and not concern over individual vendor behavior, this test
suite compensates using a 9 byte upper and lower bound when testing a set MTU boundary.
