"""Test the support of VLAN Offload Features by Poll Mode Drivers.

This test suite verifies that VLAN filtering, stripping, and header insertion all
function as expected. When a VLAN ID is in the filter list, all packets with that
ID should be forwarded and all others should be dropped. While stripping is enabled,
packets sent with a VLAN ID should have the ID removed and then be forwarded.
Additionally, when header insertion is enabled packets without a
VLAN ID should have a specified ID inserted and then be forwarded.
