"""Features common to all test suites.

The module defines the :class:`TestSuite` class which doesn't contain any test cases, and as such
must be extended by subclasses which add test cases. The :class:`TestSuite` contains the basics
needed by subclasses:

    * Testbed (SUT, TG) configuration,

    Test cases are implemented by subclasses. Test cases are all methods starting with ``test_``,
    further divided into performance test cases (starting with ``test_perf_``)
    and functional test cases (all other test cases).

    By default, all test cases will be executed. A list of testcase names may be specified
    in the YAML test run configuration file and in the :option:`--test-suite` command line argument
    or in the :envvar:`DTS_TEST_SUITES` environment variable to filter which test cases to run.
    The union of both lists will be used. Any unknown test cases from the latter lists
    will be silently ignored.

    The methods named ``[set_up|tear_down]_[suite|test_case]`` should be overridden in subclasses
    if the appropriate test suite/test case fixtures are needed.

    properly choose the IP addresses and other configuration that must be tailored to the testbed.
