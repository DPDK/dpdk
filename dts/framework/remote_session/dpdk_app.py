"""Class to run blocking DPDK apps in the background.

The class won't automatically start the app. The start-up is done as part of the
:meth:`BlockingDPDKApp.wait_until_ready` method, which will return execution to the caller only
when the desired stdout has been returned by the app. Usually this is used to detect when the app
has been loaded and ready to be used.

Example:
    ..code:: python

        pdump = BlockingDPDKApp(
            PurePath("app/dpdk-pdump"),
            app_params="--pdump 'port=0,queue=*,rx-dev=/tmp/rx-dev.pcap'"
        )
        pdump.wait_until_ready("65535") # start app

        # pdump is now ready to capture

        pdump.close() # stop/close app
