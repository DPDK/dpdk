"""Common functionality for interactive shell handling.

The base class, :class:`InteractiveShell`, is meant to be extended by subclasses that
contain functionality specific to that shell type. These subclasses will often modify things like
the prompt to expect or the arguments to pass into the application, but still utilize
the same method for sending a command and collecting output. How this output is handled however
is often application specific. If an application needs elevated privileges to start it is expected
that the method for gaining those privileges is provided when initializing the class.

This class is designed for applications like primary applications in DPDK where only one instance
of the application can be running at a given time and, for this reason, is managed using a context
manager. This context manager starts the application when you enter the context and cleans up the
application when you exit. Using a context manager for this is useful since it allows us to ensure
the application is cleaned up as soon as you leave the block regardless of the reason.

The :option:`--timeout` command line argument and the :envvar:`DTS_TIMEOUT`
environment variable configure the timeout of getting the output from command execution.
