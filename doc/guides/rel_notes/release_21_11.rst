==================

.. **Read this first.**

   The text in the sections below explains how to update the release notes.

   Use proper spelling, capitalization and punctuation in all sections.

   Variable and config names should be quoted as fixed width text:
   ``LIKE_THIS``.

   Build the docs and view the output file to ensure the changes are correct::

New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

Removed Items
-------------

.. This section should contain removed items in this release. Sample format:

   * Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the removed item
     in the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* eal: Removed the deprecated function ``rte_get_master_lcore()``
  and the iterator macro ``RTE_LCORE_FOREACH_SLAVE``.

* eal: The old api arguments that were deprecated for
  blacklist/whitelist are removed. Users must use the new
  block/allow list arguments.


API Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* kvargs: The experimental function ``rte_kvargs_strcmp()`` has been
  removed. Its usages have been replaced by a new function
  ``rte_kvargs_get_with_value()``.

* cryptodev: The API rte_cryptodev_pmd_is_valid_dev is modified to
  rte_cryptodev_is_valid_dev as it can be used by the application as
  well as PMD to check whether the device is valid or not.

* cryptodev: The rte_cryptodev_pmd.* files are renamed as cryptodev_pmd.*
  as it is for drivers only and should be private to DPDK, and not
  installed for app use.

* cryptodev: A ``reserved`` byte from structure ``rte_crypto_op`` was
  renamed to ``aux_flags`` to indicate warnings and other information from
  the crypto/security operation. This field will be used to communicate
  events such as soft expiry with IPsec in lookaside mode.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* security: ``rte_security_set_pkt_metadata`` and ``rte_security_get_userdata``
  routines used by inline outbound and inline inbound security processing were
  made inline and enhanced to do simple 64-bit set/get for PMDs that do not
  have much processing in PMD specific callbacks but just 64-bit set/get.
  This avoids a per packet function pointer jump overhead for such PMDs.

* security: A new option ``iv_gen_disable`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to disable IV generation inside PMD,
  so that application can provide its own IV and test known test vectors.

* security: A new option ``tunnel_hdr_verify`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to indicate whether outer header
  verification need to be done as part of inbound IPsec processing.

* security: A new structure ``rte_security_ipsec_lifetime`` was added to
  replace ``esn_soft_limit`` in IPsec configuration structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_xform`` to allow applications to configure SA soft
  and hard expiry limits. Limits can be either in number of packets or bytes.


Known Issues
------------

.. This section should contain new known issues in this release. Sample format:

   * **Add title in present tense with full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the known issue
     in the present tense. Add information on any known workarounds.

   with this release.

   The format is:

   * <vendor> platform with <vendor> <type of devices> combinations

     * List of CPU
     * List of OS
     * List of devices
     * Other relevant details...
