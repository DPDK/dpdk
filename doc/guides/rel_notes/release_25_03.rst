     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     =======================================================

* **Added Staged-Ordered-Ring (SORING) API to the ring library.**

  New API was added to the ring library to provide a SW abstraction
  for ordered queues with multiple processing stages.

  and even substantial part of its code.
  It can be viewed as an extension of rte_ring functionality.

  * Added statistics for failed buffer allocation and missed packets.

* **Updated AMD axgbe driver.**

  * Added support for the TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO).

* **Updated ZTE zxdh network driver.**

  * Added support for multiple queues.
  * Added support for SR-IOV VF.
  * Scatter and gather for Tx and Rx.
  * Link state and auto-negotiation.
  * MAC address filtering.

   =======================================================

* eal: The ``__rte_packed`` macro for packing data is replaced with
  ``__rte_packed_begin`` / ``__rte_packed_end``.

* build: The Intel networking drivers:
  cpfl, e1000, fm10k, i40e, iavf, ice, idpf, igc, ipn3ke and ixgbe,
  have been moved from ``drivers/net`` to a new ``drivers/net/intel`` directory.
  The resulting build output, including the driver filenames, is the same,
  but to enable/disable these drivers via Meson option requires use of the new paths.
  For example, ``-Denable_drivers=/net/i40e`` becomes ``-Denable_drivers=/net/intel/i40e``.


ABI Changes

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
