DPDK Release 23.11
==================

.. **Read this first.**

   The text in the sections below explains how to update the release notes.

   Use proper spelling, capitalization and punctuation in all sections.

   Variable and config names should be quoted as fixed width text:

* Build Requirements: From DPDK 23.11 onwards,
  building DPDK will require a C compiler which supports the C11 standard,
  including support for C11 standard atomics.

  More specifically, the requirements will be:

  * Support for flag "-std=c11" (or similar)
  * __STDC_NO_ATOMICS__ is *not defined* when using c11 flag

  Please note:

  * C11, including standard atomics, is supported from GCC version 5 onwards,
    and is the default language version in that release
    (Ref: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html)
  * C11 is the default compilation mode in Clang from version 3.6,
    which also added support for standard atomics
    (Ref: https://releases.llvm.org/3.6.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html)

------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
