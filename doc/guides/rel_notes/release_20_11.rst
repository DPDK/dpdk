New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)

  Updated the Broadcom bnxt driver with new features and improvements, including:

  * Added support for 200G PAM4 link speed.

* **Updated Cisco enic driver.**

  * Added support for VF representors with single-queue Tx/Rx and flow API
  * Added support for egress PORT_ID action

  * Added support for VXLAN decap combined with VLAN pop

* **Updated Solarflare network PMD.**

  Updated the Solarflare ``sfc_efx`` driver with changes including:

  * Added SR-IOV PF support

* **Updated Virtio driver.**

* **Extended flow-perf application.**

  * Started supporting user order instead of bit mask:
    Now the user can create any structure of rte_flow
    using flow performance application with any order,
    moreover the app also now starts to support inner
    items matching as well.
  * Added header modify actions.
  * Added flag action.
  * Added raw encap/decap actions.
  * Added VXLAN encap/decap actions.
  * Added ICMP and ICMP6 matching items.
  * Added option to set port mask for insertion/deletion:
    ``--portmask=N``
    where N represents the hexadecimal bitmask of ports used.

* **Updated the pipeline library for alignment with the P4 language.**

  Added new Software Switch (SWX) pipeline type that provides more
  flexibility through API and feature alignment with the P4 language.

  * The packet headers, meta-data, actions, tables and pipelines are
    dynamically defined instead of selected from pre-defined set.
  * The actions and the pipeline are defined with instructions.
  * Extern objects and functions can be plugged into the pipeline.
  * Transaction-oriented table updates.

-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* build macros: The macros defining ``RTE_MACHINE_CPUFLAG_*`` are removed.
  The information provided by these macros is available through standard
  compiler macros.

* eal: The ``rte_logs`` struct and global symbol was made private
  and is no longer part of the API.

* eal: Made the ``rte_dev_event`` structure private to the EAL as no public API
  used it.

* eal: ``rte_cio_rmb()`` and ``rte_cio_wmb()`` were deprecated since 20.08
  and are removed in this release.

* mem: Removed the unioned field ``phys_addr`` from
  the structures ``rte_memseg`` and ``rte_memzone``.
  The field ``iova`` is remaining from the old unions.

* mempool: Removed the unioned fields ``phys_addr`` and ``physaddr`` from
  the structures ``rte_mempool_memhdr`` and ``rte_mempool_objhdr``.
  The field ``iova`` is remaining from the old unions.
  The flag name ``MEMPOOL_F_NO_PHYS_CONTIG`` is removed,
  while the aliased flag ``MEMPOOL_F_NO_IOVA_CONTIG`` is kept.

* mbuf: Removed the functions ``rte_mbuf_data_dma_addr*``
  and the macros ``rte_pktmbuf_mtophys*``.
  The same functionality is still available with the functions and macros
  having ``iova`` in their names instead of ``dma_addr`` or ``mtophys``.

* mbuf: Removed the unioned field ``buf_physaddr`` from ``rte_mbuf``.
  The field ``buf_iova`` is remaining from the old union.

* mbuf: Removed the unioned field ``refcnt_atomic`` from
  the structures ``rte_mbuf`` and ``rte_mbuf_ext_shared_info``.
  The field ``refcnt`` is remaining from the old unions.

* pci: Removed the ``rte_kernel_driver`` enum defined in rte_dev.h and
  replaced with a private enum in the PCI subsystem.

* pci: Removed the PCI resources map API from the public API
  (``pci_map_resource`` and ``pci_unmap_resource``) and moved it to the
  PCI bus driver along with the PCI resources lists and associated structures
  (``pci_map``, ``pci_msix_table``, ``mapped_pci_resource`` and
  ``mapped_pci_res_list``).

* ethdev: Removed the ``kdrv`` field in the ethdev ``rte_eth_dev_data``
  structure as it gave no useful abstracted information to the applications.

* ethdev: ``rte_eth_rx_descriptor_done()`` API has been deprecated.

* Renamed internal ethdev APIs:

  * ``_rte_eth_dev_callback_process()`` -> ``rte_eth_dev_callback_process()``
  * ``_rte_eth_dev_reset`` -> ``rte_eth_dev_internal_reset()``

* vhost: Moved vDPA APIs from experimental to stable.

* rawdev: Added a structure size parameter to the functions
  ``rte_rawdev_queue_setup()``, ``rte_rawdev_queue_conf_get()``,
  ``rte_rawdev_info_get()`` and ``rte_rawdev_configure()``,
  allowing limited driver type-checking and ABI compatibility.

* rawdev: Changed the return type of the function ``rte_dev_info_get()``
  and the function ``rte_rawdev_queue_conf_get()``
  from ``void`` to ``int`` allowing the return of error codes from drivers.

* rawdev: The running of a drivers ``selftest()`` function can now be done
  using the ``rawdev_autotest`` command in the ``dpdk-test`` binary. This
  command now calls the self-test function for each rawdev found on the
  system, and does not require a specific command per device type.
  Following this change, the ``ioat_rawdev_autotest`` command has been
  removed as no longer needed.

* stack: the experimental tag has been dropped from the stack library, and its
  interfaces are considered stable as of DPDK 20.11.

* bpf: ``RTE_BPF_XTYPE_NUM`` has been dropped from ``rte_bpf_xtype``.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* ``ethdev`` changes

  * Following device operation function pointers moved
    from ``struct eth_dev_ops`` to ``struct rte_eth_dev``:

    * ``eth_rx_queue_count_t       rx_queue_count;``
    * ``eth_rx_descriptor_done_t   rx_descriptor_done;``
    * ``eth_rx_descriptor_status_t rx_descriptor_status;``
    * ``eth_tx_descriptor_status_t tx_descriptor_status;``

  * ``struct eth_dev_ops`` is no more accessible by applications,
    which was already internal data structure.

  * ``ethdev`` internal functions are marked with ``__rte_internal`` tag.

   * **Add title in present tense with full stop.**
