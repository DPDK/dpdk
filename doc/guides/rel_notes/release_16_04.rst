New Features
------------

This section should contain new features added in this release. Sample format:

* **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

  Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense. The description
  should be enough to allow someone scanning the release notes to understand
  the new feature.

  If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list like this.

  * Added feature foo to do something.
  * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

  Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

* **Added function to check primary process state.**

  A new function ``rte_eal_primary_proc_alive()`` has been added
  to allow the user to detect if a primary process is running.
  Use cases for this feature include fault detection, and monitoring
  using secondary processes.

* **Enabled bulk allocation of mbufs.**

  A new function ``rte_pktmbuf_alloc_bulk()`` has been added to allow the user
  to allocate a bulk of mbufs.

* **Virtio 1.0.**

  Enabled virtio 1.0 support for virtio pmd driver.

* **Supported virtio for ARM.**

  Enabled virtio support for armv7/v8. Tested for arm64.
  Virtio for arm support VFIO-noiommu mode only.
  Virtio can work with other non-x86 arch too like powerpc.

* **Supported virtio offload in vhost-user.**

  Add the offload and negotiation of checksum and TSO between vhost-user and
  vanilla Linux virtio guest.

* **Added vhost-user live migration support.**

* **Enabled PCI extended tag for i40e.**

  It enabled extended tag by checking and writing corresponding PCI config
  space bytes, to boost the performance. In the meanwhile, it deprecated the
  legacy way via reading/writing sysfile supported by kernel module igb_uio.

* **Increased number of next hops for LPM IPv4 to 2^24.**

  The next_hop field is extended from 8 bits to 24 bits for IPv4.

* **Added support of SNOW 3G (UEA2 and UIA2) for Intel Quick Assist devices.**

  Enabled support for SNOW 3G wireless algorithm for Intel Quick Assist devices.
  Support for cipher only, hash only is also provided
  along with alg-chaining operations.


Resolved Issues
---------------

This section should contain bug fixes added to the relevant sections. Sample format:

* **code/section: Fixed issue in the past tense with a full stop.**

  Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the resolved issue in the past tense.
  The title should contain the code/lib section like a commit message.
  Add the entries in alphabetic order in the relevant sections below.


EAL
~~~


Drivers
~~~~~~~

* **ethdev: Fixed byte order consistency between fdir flow and mask.**

  Fixed issue in ethdev library that the structure for setting
  fdir's mask and flow entry was not consistent in byte ordering.

* **aesni_mb: Fixed wrong return value when creating a device.**

  cryptodev_aesni_mb_init() was returning the device id of the device created,
  instead of 0 (when success), that rte_eal_vdev_init() expects.
  This made impossible the creation of more than one aesni_mb device
  from command line.


Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

* **hash: Fixed CRC32c hash computation for non multiple of 4 bytes sizes.**

  Fix crc32c hash functions to return a valid crc32c value for data lengths
  not multiple of 4 bytes.


Examples
~~~~~~~~

* **examples/vhost: Fixed frequent mbuf allocation failure.**

  vhost-switch often fails to allocate mbuf when dequeue from vring because it
  wrongly calculates the number of mbufs needed.


Other
~~~~~


Known Issues
------------

This section should contain new known issues in this release. Sample format:

* **Add title in present tense with full stop.**

  Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the known issue in the present
  tense. Add information on any known workarounds.


API Changes
-----------

This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

* Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change. Use fixed width
  quotes for ``rte_function_names`` or ``rte_struct_names``. Use the past tense.

* The fields in ethdev structure ``rte_eth_fdir_masks`` were changed
  to be in big endian.

* The LPM ``next_hop`` field is extended from 8 bits to 24 bits for IPv4
  while keeping ABI compatibility.

* A new ``rte_lpm_config`` structure is used so LPM library will allocate
  exactly the amount of memory which is necessary to hold application’s rules.
  The previous ABI is kept for compatibility.

* The prototype for the pipeline input port, output port and table action
  handlers are updated: the pipeline parameter is added,
  the packets mask parameter has been either removed or made input-only.


ABI Changes
-----------

* Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change that was announced in
  the previous releases and made in this release. Use fixed width quotes for
  ``rte_function_names`` or ``rte_struct_names``. Use the past tense.

* The RETA entry size in ``rte_eth_rss_reta_entry64`` has been increased
  from 8-bit to 16-bit.

* The cmdline buffer size has been increase from 256 to 512.
