* **code/section Fixed issue in the past tense with a full stop.**

  Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the resolved issue in the past tense.
  The title should contain the code/lib section like a commit message.

EAL
~~~


Drivers
~~~~~~~

* **aesni_mb: Fixed wrong return value when creating a device.**

  cryptodev_aesni_mb_init() was returning the device id of the device created,
  instead of 0 (when success), that rte_eal_vdev_init() expects.
  This made impossible the creation of more than one aesni_mb device
  from command line.
