New Features

     should be enough to allow someone scanning the release notes to understand
     the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list like this.

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     =========================================================

* **Added generic flow API (rte_flow).**

  This API provides a generic means to configure hardware to match specific
  ingress or egress traffic, alter its fate and query related counters
  according to any number of user-defined rules.

  It is slightly higher-level than the legacy filtering framework which it
  encompasses and supersedes (including all functions and filter types) in
  order to expose a single interface with an unambiguous behavior that is
  common to all poll-mode drivers (PMDs).

  See the :ref:`Generic flow API <Generic_flow_API>` documentation for more
  information.
