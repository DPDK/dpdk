Configuration
-------------

Runtime Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Safe Mode Support`` (default ``0``)

  If driver failed to load OS package, by default driver's initialization failed.
  But if user intend to use the device without OS package, user can take ``devargs``
  parameter ``safe-mode-support``, for example::

    -a 80:00.0,safe-mode-support=1

  Then the driver will be initialized successfully and the device will enter Safe Mode.
  NOTE: In Safe mode, only very limited features are available, features like RSS,
  checksum, fdir, tunneling ... are all disabled.

- ``Default MAC Disable`` (default ``0``)

  Disable the default MAC make the device drop all packets by default,
  only packets hit on filter rules will pass.

  Default MAC can be disabled by setting the devargs parameter ``default-mac-disable``,
  for example::

    -a 80:00.0,default-mac-disable=1

- ``Protocol extraction for per queue``

  Configure the RX queues to do protocol extraction into mbuf for protocol
  handling acceleration, like checking the TCP SYN packets quickly.

  The argument format is::

      18:00.0,proto_xtr=<queues:protocol>[<queues:protocol>...],field_offs=<offset>, \
      field_name=<name>
      18:00.0,proto_xtr=<protocol>,field_offs=<offset>,field_name=<name>

  Queues are grouped by ``(`` and ``)`` within the group. The ``-`` character
  is used as a range separator and ``,`` is used as a single number separator.
  The grouping ``()`` can be omitted for single element group. If no queues are
  specified, PMD will use this protocol extraction type for all queues.
  ``field_offs`` is the offset of mbuf dynamic field for protocol extraction data.
  ``field_name`` is the name of mbuf dynamic field for protocol extraction data.
  ``field_offs`` and ``field_name`` will be checked whether it is valid. If invalid,
  an error print will be returned: ``Invalid field offset or name, no match dynfield``,
  and the proto_ext function will not be enabled.

  Protocol is : ``vlan, ipv4, ipv6, ipv6_flow, tcp, ip_offset``.

  .. code-block:: console

    dpdk-testpmd -c 0xff -- -i
    port stop 0
    port detach 0
    port attach 18:00.0,proto_xtr='[(1,2-3,8-9):tcp,10-13:vlan]',field_offs=92,field_name=pmd_dyn

  This setting means queues 1, 2-3, 8-9 are TCP extraction, queues 10-13 are
  VLAN extraction, other queues run with no protocol extraction. The offset of mbuf
  dynamic field is 92 for all queues with protocol extraction.

  .. code-block:: console

    dpdk-testpmd -c 0xff -- -i
    port stop 0
    port detach 0
    port attach 18:00.0,proto_xtr=vlan,proto_xtr='[(1,2-3,8-9):tcp,10-23:ipv6]', \
    field_offs=92,field_name=pmd_dyn

  This setting means queues 1, 2-3, 8-9 are TCP extraction, queues 10-23 are
  IPv6 extraction, other queues use the default VLAN extraction. The offset of mbuf
  dynamic field is 92 for all queues with protocol extraction.

  The extraction metadata is copied into the registered dynamic mbuf field, and
  the related dynamic mbuf flags is set.

  .. table:: Protocol extraction : ``vlan``

   +----------------------------+----------------------------+

  IPHDR1 - Outer/Single IPv4 Header offset.

  IPHDR2 - Outer/Single IPv6 Header offset.

- ``Hardware debug mask log support`` (default ``0``)

  User can enable the related hardware debug mask such as ICE_DBG_NVM::

    -a 0000:88:00.0,hw_debug_mask=0x80 --log-level=pmd.net.ice.driver:8

  These ICE_DBG_XXX are defined in ``drivers/net/ice/base/ice_type.h``.

- ``1PPS out support``

  The E810 supports four single-ended GPIO signals (SDP[20:23]). The 1PPS
  signal outputs via SDP[20:23]. User can select GPIO pin index flexibly.
  Pin index 0 means SDP20, 1 means SDP21 and so on. For example::

    -a af:00.0,pps_out='[pin:0]'

- ``Low Rx latency`` (default ``0``)

  vRAN workloads require low latency DPDK interface for the front haul
  interface connection to Radio. By specifying ``1`` for parameter
  ``rx_low_latency``, each completed Rx descriptor can be written immediately
  to host memory and the Rx interrupt latency can be reduced to 2us::

    -a 0000:88:00.0,rx_low_latency=1

  As a trade-off, this configuration may cause the packet processing performance
  degradation due to the PCI bandwidth limitation.

- ``Tx diagnostics`` (default ``not enabled``)

  Set the ``devargs`` parameter ``mbuf_check`` to enable Tx diagnostics.
  For example, ``-a 81:00.0,mbuf_check=<case>`` or ``-a 81:00.0,mbuf_check=[<case1>,<case2>...]``.
  Thereafter, ``rte_eth_xstats_get()`` can be used to get the error counts,
  which are collected in ``tx_mbuf_error_packets`` xstats.
  In testpmd these can be shown via: ``testpmd> show port xstats all``.
  Supported values for the ``case`` parameter are:

  * ``mbuf``: Check for corrupted mbuf.
  * ``size``: Check min/max packet length according to HW spec.
  * ``segment``: Check number of mbuf segments does not exceed HW limits.
  * ``offload``: Check for use of an unsupported offload flag.

Driver compilation and testing
------------------------------

Refer to the document :ref:`compiling and testing a PMD for a NIC <pmd_build_and_test>`
for details.

Features
--------

Vector PMD
~~~~~~~~~~

Vector PMD for RX and TX path are selected automatically. The paths
are chosen based on 2 conditions.

- ``CPU``
  On the X86 platform, the driver checks if the CPU supports AVX2.
  If it's supported, AVX2 paths will be chosen. If not, SSE is chosen.
  If the CPU supports AVX512 and EAL argument ``--force-max-simd-bitwidth``
  is set to 512, AVX512 paths will be chosen.

- ``Offload features``
  The supported HW offload features are described in the document ice.ini,
  A value "P" means the offload feature is not supported by vector path.
  If any not supported features are used, ICE vector PMD is disabled and the
  normal paths are chosen.

Malicious driver detection (MDD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's not appropriate to send a packet, if this packet's destination MAC address
is just this port's MAC address. If SW tries to send such packets, HW will
report a MDD event and drop the packets.

The APPs based on DPDK should avoid providing such packets.

Device Config Function (DCF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates ICE DCF PMD, which shares the core module with ICE
PMD and iAVF PMD.

A DCF (Device Config Function) PMD bounds to the device's trusted VF with ID 0,
it can act as a sole controlling entity to exercise advance functionality (such
as switch, ACL) for the rest VFs.

The DCF PMD needs to advertise and acquire DCF capability which allows DCF to
send AdminQ commands that it would like to execute over to the PF and receive
responses for the same from PF.

Forward Error Correction (FEC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supports get/set FEC mode and get FEC capability.

Time Synchronisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system operator can run a PTP (Precision Time Protocol) client application
to synchronise the time on the network card (and optionally the time on the
system) to the PTP master.

ICE PMD supports PTP client applications that use the DPDK IEEE1588 API to
communicate with the PTP master clock. Note that the PTP client application
needs to run on the PF and vector mode needs to be disabled.

.. code-block:: console

    examples/dpdk-ptpclient -c f -n 3 -a 0000:ec:00.1 -- -T 1 -p 0x1 --controller=pi

Generic Flow Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ice PMD provides support for the Generic Flow API (RTE_FLOW), enabling
users to offload various flow classification tasks to the E810 NIC.
The E810 NIC's  packet processing pipeline consists of the following stages:

Switch: Supports exact match and limited wildcard matching with a large flow
capacity.

ACL: Supports wildcard matching with a smaller flow capacity (DCF mode only).

FDIR: Supports exact match with a large flow capacity (PF mode only).

Hash: Supports RSS (PF mode only)

The ice PMD utilizes the ice_flow_engine structure to represent each of these
stages and leverages the rte_flow rule's ``group`` attribute for selecting the
appropriate engine for Switch, ACL, and FDIR operations:

Group 0 maps to Switch
Group 1 maps to ACL
Group 2 maps to FDIR

In the case of RSS, it will only be selected if a ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_RSS`` action
is targeted to no queue group, and the group attribute is ignored.

For each engine, a list of supported patterns is maintained in a global array
named ``ice_<engine>_supported_pattern``. The Ice PMD will reject any rule with
a pattern that is not included in the supported list.

One notable feature is the ice PMD's ability to leverage the Raw pattern,
enabling protocol-agnostic flow offloading. Here is an example of creating
a rule that matches an IPv4 destination address of 1.2.3.4 and redirects it to
queue 3 using a raw pattern::

  flow create 0 ingress group 2 pattern raw \
  pattern spec \
  00000000000000000000000008004500001400004000401000000000000001020304 \
  pattern mask \
  000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff \
  end actions queue index 3 / mark id 3 / end

Currently, raw pattern support is limited to the FDIR and Hash engines.

Traffic Management Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ice PMD provides support for the Traffic Management API (RTE_TM),
allow users to offload a 3-layers Tx scheduler on the E810 NIC:

- ``Port Layer``

  This is the root layer, support peak bandwidth configuration,
  max to 32 children.

- ``Queue Group Layer``

  The middle layer, support peak / committed bandwidth, weight, priority configurations,
  max to 8 children.

- ``Queue Layer``

  The leaf layer, support peak / committed bandwidth, weight, priority configurations.

Additional Options
++++++++++++++++++

- ``Disable ACL Engine`` (default ``enabled``)

  By default, all flow engines are enabled. But if user does not need the
  ACL engine related functions, user can set ``devargs`` parameter
  ``acl=off`` to disable the ACL engine and shorten the startup time.

    -a 18:01.0,cap=dcf,acl=off

.. _figure_ice_dcf:

.. figure:: img/ice_dcf.*

   DCF Communication flow.

#. Create the VFs::

      echo 4 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:18\:00.0/sriov_numvfs

#. Enable the VF0 trust on::

      ip link set dev enp24s0f0 vf 0 trust on

#. Bind the VF0, and run testpmd with 'cap=dcf' with port representor for VF 1 and 2::

      dpdk-testpmd -l 22-25 -n 4 -a 18:01.0,cap=dcf,representor=vf[1-2] -- -i

#. Monitor the VF2 interface network traffic::

      tcpdump -e -nn -i enp24s1f2

#. Create one flow to redirect the traffic to VF2 by DCF (assume the representor port ID is 5)::

      flow create 0 priority 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 src is 192.168.0.2 \
      dst is 192.168.0.3 / end actions represented_port ethdev_port_id 5 / end

#. Send the packet, and it should be displayed on tcpdump::

      sendp(Ether(src='3c:fd:fe:aa:bb:78', dst='00:00:00:01:02:03')/IP(src=' \
      192.168.0.2', dst="192.168.0.3")/TCP(flags='S')/Raw(load='XXXXXXXXXX'), \
      iface="enp24s0f0", count=10)

Sample Application Notes
------------------------

Vlan filter
~~~~~~~~~~~

Vlan filter only works when Promiscuous mode is off.

To start ``testpmd``, and add vlan 10 to port 0:

.. code-block:: console

    ./app/dpdk-testpmd -l 0-15 -n 4 -- -i
    ...

    testpmd> rx_vlan add 10 0

Diagnostic Utilities
--------------------

Dump DDP Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dump the runtime packet processing pipeline configuration into a binary file.
This helps the support team diagnose hardware configuration issues.

Usage::

    testpmd> ddp dump <port_id> <output_file>

Dump Switch Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dump detail hardware configurations related to the switch pipeline stage into a binary file.

Usage::

    testpmd> ddp dump switch <port_id> <output_file>

Dump Tx Scheduling Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dump the runtime Tx scheduling tree into a DOT file.

Usage::

    testpmd> txsched dump <port_id> <brief|detail> <output_file>

In "brief" mode, all scheduling nodes in the tree are displayed.
In "detail" mode, each node's configuration parameters are also displayed.

Limitations or Known issues
---------------------------

The Intel E810 requires a programmable pipeline package be downloaded
by the driver to support normal operations. The E810 has a limited
functionality built in to allow PXE boot and other use cases, but the
driver must download a package file during the driver initialization
stage.

The default DDP package file name is ice.pkg. For a specific NIC, the
DDP package supposed to be loaded can have a filename: ice-xxxxxx.pkg,
where 'xxxxxx' is the 64-bit PCIe Device Serial Number of the NIC. For
example, if the NIC's device serial number is 00-CC-BB-FF-FF-AA-05-68,
the device-specific DDP package filename is ice-00ccbbffffaa0568.pkg
(in hex and all low case). During initialization, the driver searches
in the following paths in order: /lib/firmware/updates/intel/ice/ddp
and /lib/firmware/intel/ice/ddp. The corresponding device-specific DDP
package will be downloaded first if the file exists. If not, then the
driver tries to load the default package. The type of loaded package
is stored in ``ice_adapter->active_pkg_type``.

A symbolic link to the DDP package file is also ok. The same package
file is used by both the kernel driver and the DPDK PMD.

   .. Note::

      Windows support: The DDP package is not supported on Windows so,
      loading of the package is disabled on Windows.
