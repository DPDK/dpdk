L2 Forwarding Sample Application (in Real and Virtualized Environments) with core load statistics
=================================================================================================

The L2 Forwarding sample application is a simple example of packet processing using
the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) which
also takes advantage of Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) features in a virtualized environment.

.. note::

    This application is a variation of L2 Forwarding sample application. It demonstrate possible
    scheme of job stats library usage therefore some parts of this document is identical with original
    L2 forwarding application.

Overview
--------

The L2 Forwarding sample application, which can operate in real and virtualized environments,
performs L2 forwarding for each packet that is received.
The destination port is the adjacent port from the enabled portmask
if: the first four ports are enabled (portmask ``0xf``),
ports 1 and 2 forward into each other, and ports 3 and 4 forward into each other.

The MAC addresses are affected as follows:

*   The source MAC address is replaced by the TX port MAC address

*   The destination MAC address is replaced by ``02:00:00:00:00:TX_PORT_ID``

This application can be used to benchmark performance using a traffic-generator, as shown in the :numref:`figure_l2_fwd_benchmark_setup_jobstats`.

The application can also be used in a virtualized environment as shown in :numref:`figure_l2_fwd_virtenv_benchmark_setup_jobstats`.

The L2 Forwarding application can also be used as a starting point for developing a new application based on the DPDK.

Virtual Function Setup Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This application can use the virtual function available in the system and
can be used in a virtual machine without passing through
the whole Network Device into a guest machine when in a virtualized scenario.
The virtual functions can be enabled in the host machine or the hypervisor with the respective physical function driver.

For example, in a Linux* host machine, it is possible to enable a virtual function using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    modprobe ixgbe max_vfs=2,2

This command enables two Virtual Functions on each of Physical Function of the NIC,
with two physical ports in the PCI configuration space.
It is important to note that enabled Virtual Function 0 and 2 would belong to Physical Function 0
and Virtual Function 1 and 3 would belong to Physical Function 1,
enabling a total of four Virtual Functions (in this case).


Compiling the Application
-------------------------

To compile the sample application, see :doc:`compiling`.

The application is located in the ``l2fwd-jobstats`` sub-directory.


Running the Application
-----------------------

The application requires a number of command line options:

.. code-block:: console

    ./<build_dir>/examples/dpdk-l2fwd-jobstats [EAL options] -- -p PORTMASK [-q NQ] [-l]

where,

*   p PORTMASK: A hexadecimal bitmask of the ports to configure

*   q NQ: Maximum number of queues per lcore (default is 1)

*   l: Use locale thousands separator when formatting big numbers.

To run the application in a Linux environment with 4 lcores, 16 ports, 8 RX queues per lcore
and thousands separator printing, issue the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./<build_dir>/examples/dpdk-l2fwd-jobstats -l 0-3 -n 4 -- -q 8 -p ffff -l

Refer to the *DPDK Getting Started Guide* for general information on running applications
and the Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL) options.


Explanation
-----------

The following sections provide explanation of the code.


Command Line Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The L2 Forwarding sample application takes specific parameters
in addition to Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL) arguments
(see `Running the Application`_).
The preferred way to parse parameters is to use the ``getopt()`` function,
since it is part of a well-defined and portable library.

The parsing of arguments is done in the ``l2fwd_parse_args()`` function.
This method of argument parsing is not described here.
Refer to the *glibc getopt(3)* man page for details.

EAL arguments are parsed first, then application-specific arguments.
This is done at the beginning of the ``main()`` function:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Init EAL. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of init EAL.
    :dedent: 1

Mbuf Pool Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the arguments are parsed, the mbuf pool is created.
The mbuf pool contains a set of mbuf objects that will be used by the driver
and the application to store network packet data:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Create the mbuf pool. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of creation of mbuf pool.
    :dedent: 1

The rte_mempool is a generic structure used to handle pools of objects.
In this case, it is necessary to create a pool that will be used by the driver.
The number of allocated pkt mbufs is ``NB_MBUF``,
with a data room size of ``RTE_MBUF_DEFAULT_BUF_SIZE`` each.
A per-lcore cache of ``MEMPOOL_CACHE_SIZE`` mbufs is kept.
The memory is allocated in ``rte_socket_id()`` socket,
but it is possible to extend this code to allocate one mbuf pool per socket.

The ``rte_pktmbuf_pool_create()`` function uses the default mbuf pool and mbuf
initializers, respectively ``rte_pktmbuf_pool_init()`` and ``rte_pktmbuf_init()``.
An advanced application may want to use the mempool API to create the
mbuf pool with more control.

Driver Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main part of the code in the ``main()`` function relates to the initialization of the driver.
To fully understand this code, it is recommended to study the chapters that related to the Poll Mode Driver
in the *DPDK Programmer's Guide* and the *DPDK API Reference*.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Reset l2fwd_dst_ports. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of reset l2fwd_dst_ports.
    :dedent: 1

The next step is to configure the RX and TX queues.
For each port, there is only one RX queue (only one lcore is able to poll a given port).
The number of TX queues depends on the number of available lcores.
The ``rte_eth_dev_configure()`` function is used to configure the number of queues for a port:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Configure the RX and TX queues. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of configuring the RX and TX queues.
    :dedent: 2

RX Queue Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application uses one lcore to poll one or several ports, depending on the -q option,
which specifies the number of queues per lcore.

For example, if the user specifies -q 4, the application is able to poll four ports with one lcore.
If there are 16 ports on the target (and if the portmask argument is -p ffff ),
the application will need four lcores to poll all the ports.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: RX queue initialization. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of RX queue initialization.
    :dedent: 2

The list of queues that must be polled for a given lcore is stored in a private structure called struct lcore_queue_conf.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: List of queues to be polled for given lcore. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of list of queues to be polled for given lcore.

Values of struct lcore_queue_conf:

*   n_rx_port and rx_port_list[] are used in the main packet processing loop
    (see Section `Receive, Process and Transmit Packets`_ later in this chapter).

*   rx_timers and flush_timer are used to ensure forced TX on low packet rate.

*   flush_job, idle_job and jobs_context are librte_jobstats objects used for managing l2fwd jobs.

*   stats_read_pending and lock are used during job stats read phase.

TX Queue Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each lcore should be able to transmit on any port. For every port, a single TX queue is initialized.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Init one TX queue on each port. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of init one TX queue on each port.
    :dedent: 2

Jobs statistics initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several statistics objects available:

*   Flush job statistics

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Add flush job. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of add flush job.
    :dedent: 2

*   Statistics per RX port

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Setup forward job. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of forward job.
    :dedent: 3

Following parameters are passed to ``rte_jobstats_init()``:

*   0 as minimal poll period

*   drain_tsc as maximum poll period

*   MAX_PKT_BURST as desired target value (RX burst size)

Main loop
~~~~~~~~~

The forwarding path is reworked comparing to original L2 Forwarding application.
In the ``l2fwd_main_loop()`` function, three loops are placed.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Minimize impact of stats reading. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of minimize impact of stats reading.
    :dedent: 1

The first infinite for loop is to minimize impact of stats reading.
Lock is only locked/unlocked when asked.

Second inner while loop do the whole jobs management.
When any job is ready, the use ``rte_timer_manage()`` is used to call the job handler.

In this place, functions ``l2fwd_fwd_job()`` and ``l2fwd_flush_job()`` are called when needed.
Then, ``rte_jobstats_context_finish()`` is called to mark loop end -
no other jobs are ready to execute.
By this time, stats are ready to be read
and if stats_read_pending is set, loop breaks allowing stats to be read.

Third do-while loop is the idle job (idle stats counter).
Its only purpose is monitoring if any job is ready
or stats job read is pending for this lcore.
Statistics from this part of the code is considered as
the headroom available for additional processing.

Receive, Process and Transmit Packets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main task of ``l2fwd_fwd_job()`` function is to read ingress packets
from the Rx queue of particular port and forward it.
This is done using the following code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Call rx burst 2 times. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of call rx burst 2 times.
    :dedent: 1

Packets are read in a burst of size MAX_PKT_BURST.
Then, each mbuf in the table is processed by the ``l2fwd_simple_forward()`` function.
The processing is very simple: process the TX port from the RX port, then replace the source and destination MAC addresses.

The ``rte_eth_rx_burst()`` function writes the mbuf pointers in a local table
and returns the number of available mbufs in the table.

After first read, a second try is issued.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Read second try. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of read second try.
    :dedent: 1

This second read is important to give the job stats library
feedback of how many packets were processed.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Adjust period time in which we are running here. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of adjust period time in which we are running.
    :dedent: 1

To maximize performance, exactly ``MAX_PKT_BURST`` is expected (the target value)
to be read for each ``l2fwd_fwd_job()`` call.
If ``total_nb_rx`` is smaller than target value ``job->period`` will be increased.
If it is greater, the period will be decreased.

.. note::

    In the following code, one line for getting the output port requires some explanation.

During the initialization process,
a static array of destination ports (``l2fwd_dst_ports[]``)
is filled such that for each source port,
a destination port is assigned that is either the next or previous enabled port from the portmask.
Naturally, the number of ports in the portmask must be even, otherwise, the application exits.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Start of l2fwd_simple_forward. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of l2fwd_simple_forward.

Then, the packet is sent using the ``l2fwd_send_packet(m, dst_port)`` function.
For this test application, the processing is exactly the same for all packets arriving on the same RX port.
Therefore, it would have been possible to call the ``l2fwd_send_burst()`` function
directly from the main loop
to send all the received packets on the same TX port,
using the burst-oriented send function, which is more efficient.

However, in real-life applications (such as, L3 routing),
packet N is not necessarily forwarded on the same port as packet N-1.
The application is implemented to illustrate that, so the same approach can be reused in a more complex application.

The ``l2fwd_send_packet()`` function stores the packet in a per-lcore and per-txport table.
If the table is full, the whole packets table is transmitted
using the ``l2fwd_send_burst()`` function:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-crypto/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Enqueue packets for TX and prepare them to be sent. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of Enqueuing packets for TX.

To ensure that no packets remain in the tables, the flush job exists.
The ``l2fwd_flush_job()``
is called periodically to for each lcore draining TX queue of each port.
This technique introduces some latency when there are not many packets to send,
however it improves performance:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-jobstats/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Draining TX queue of each port. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of draining TX queue of each port.
