/**
 * Selector table select
 *
 * This operation selects a member from the given group based on a hasing scheme.
 *
 * Multiple invocations of this function may be required in order to complete a single select
 * operation for a given table and a given group ID. The completion of the operation is flagged by
 * a return value of 1; in case of a return value of 0, the function must be invoked again with
 * exactly the same arguments.
 *
 * The mailbox argument is used to store the context of each on-going  operation. The mailbox
 * mechanism allows for multiple concurrent select operations into the same table.
 *
 * The typical reason an implementation may choose to split the operation into multiple steps is to
 * hide the latency of the inherent memory read operations: before a read operation with the
 * source data likely not in the CPU cache, the source data prefetch is issued and the operation is
 * postponed in favor of some other unrelated work, which the CPU executes in parallel with the
 * source data being fetched into the CPU cache; later on, the operation is resumed, this time with
 * the source data likely to be read from the CPU cache with no CPU pipeline stall, which
 * significantly improves the operation performance.
 *
 * @param[in] table
 *   Selector table handle.
 * @param[in] mailbox
 *   Mailbox for the current operation.
 * @param[in] group_id_buffer
 *   Buffer where the input group ID is located at offset *group_id_offset*.
 * @param[in] selector_buffer
 *   Buffer where the key to select a member within the identified group is located starting from
 *   offset *selector_offset*. Its size must be equal to the table *selector_size*.
 * @param[in] member_id_buffer
 *   Buffer where the output member ID is to be placed at offset *member_id_offset*.
 * @return
 *   0 when the operation is not yet completed, and 1 when the operation is complete. No other
 *   return values are allowed.
