 * RTE Ring
 *
 * The Ring Manager is a fixed-size queue, implemented as a table of
 * pointers. Head and tail pointers are modified atomically, allowing
 * concurrent access to it. It has the following features:
 *
 * - FIFO (First In First Out)
 * - Maximum size is fixed; the pointers are stored in a table.
 * - Lockless implementation.
 * - Multi- or single-consumer dequeue.
 * - Multi- or single-producer enqueue.
 * - Bulk dequeue.
 * - Bulk enqueue.
 *
 * Note: the ring implementation is not preemptable. A lcore must not
 * be interrupted by another task that uses the same ring.
